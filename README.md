## About

By default, FLSUN does not use builds from official GitHub repositories. Updates point to Gitee repositories which are very slow, sometimes inaccessible and not updated.
In addition, during Delta Calibration, tower angles and delta radius are never recalculated in their Klipper build, which can cause several issues.

This procedure explains the whole process in order to obtain Root access on the Speeder Pad, to configure it correctly with optimized printer settings.

This settings are compatible with FLSUN Speeder Pad.

- Useful and automated macros with notifications to KlipperScreen
- Configuration for ADXL345
- Improved Start/End Gcodes
- And more...

<br />

## Update V400 Motherboard Firmware (MKS Robin Nano V2.0 / Nano V2.1 Clone)

It's important that your motherboard firmware version matches with the installed Klipper version.

Version is visible on `System Loads` tile -> `mcu` section (in `Machine` tab).

To update firmware, follow these instructions:

- In the SSH command prompt window, enter the following commands (one at a time):
```
cd ~/klipper/
```
```
make menuconfig
```
- Move on the menu with the `Up` and `Down` keys of your keyboard and validate the selected item with the `Enter` key and select these settings:

- Then on your keyboard press the `Q` key then `Y` to save configuration.

- Enter the following commands to compile firmware (one at a time):
```
make clean
```
```
make
```
- Then this one to convert firmware:
```
./scripts/update_mks_robin.py out/klipper.bin out/Robin_nano35.bin
```
- V400 motherboard doesn't support DFU mode, so it's not possible to install the firmware directly. It's therefore necessary to install it manually.

- Get the firmware named `Robin_nano35.bin` in `/home/pi/klipper/out/` directory (on the left part of MobaXterm).

- Copy it to the root of an microSD card formatted in FAT32 and an allocation size of 4096.

- Insert the microSD card into the motherboard then turn on the printer.

- Installation only takes a few seconds, to verify that the firmware has been successfully installed, the file on the microSD card must have been renamed to `ROBIN_NANO35.BIN.CUR`.

- Go to your Mainsail Web interface then click on `Machine` tab.

- Then upload `KlipperScreen.conf`, `printer.cfg`, `macros.cfg`, `neopixels.cfg`, `adxl345_pico.cfg` and `adxl345_fysetc.cfg` files located in `Configurations` directory according to your printer.

- Restart Speeder Pad and printer to take effect.

<br />

**In case you use more than 1 instance:**

- Download and unzip my repository zip file here: https://github.com/Guilouz/Klipper-Flsun-Speeder-Pad/archive/refs/heads/main.zip

- Go to your Mainsail Web interface then click on `Machine` tab.

- Then upload `KlipperScreen.conf`, `printer.cfg`, `macros.cfg`, `neopixels.cfg`, `adxl345_pico.cfg` and `adxl345_fysetc.cfg` files located in `Configurations` directory according to your printer.

- Open the `KlipperScreen.conf` file and edit it to enable multiple instance by removing the `#` symbols like this:

  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12702322/197651386-5a33d848-0416-421a-871f-c25288c84d4d.jpg" width="700">

- Go to the Mainsail settings (gear at the top right of the interface) and select `PRINTERS` tab.

- Add as many printers as you have installed instances of Klipper/Moonraker by adding the IP address of your Speeder Pad and the port of each instance (The same IP addresses and ports obtained after installing Moonraker) like this:

  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12702322/197652480-330ed03f-4820-4507-a0e1-755ce286ea44.jpg" width="700">

- You can now select `Printers` on left tab and switch to others printers.

- You need to upload `printer.cfg`, `macros.cfg`, `neopixels.cfg`, `adxl345_pico.cfg` and `adxl345_fysetc.cfg` files for each printer.

- Open `printer.cfg` file, find `[save_variables]` and `[virtual_sdcard]` sections and edit paths for each configured printer:

**For 1st printer:**
```
[save_variables]
filename: ~/printer_1_data/config/variables.cfg

[virtual_sdcard]
path: ~/printer_1_data/gcodes
```

**For 2nd printer:**
```
[save_variables]
filename: ~/printer_2_data/config/variables.cfg

[virtual_sdcard]
path: ~/printer_2_data/gcodes
```

**For 3rd printer:**
```
[save_variables]
filename: ~/printer_3_data/config/variables.cfg

[virtual_sdcard]
path: ~/printer_3_data/gcodes
```

**Note:** Changes in the `KlipperScreen.conf` file only have an effect on the first configured printer, it's not needed on others.

- Restart Speeder Pad and printer to take effect.

**Note:** You can select printer you want at startup on the screen. You can also enable `default_printer` setting in `KlipperScreen.conf` to start directly on printer you want and switch to others with shuffle button on the left side.

<br />

## Get USB Serial from Motherboard

- Connect your printer to one of the Speeder Pad's USB ports.

- Connect in SSH then enter the following command to retrieve the motherboard USB serial:
```
cd ~ && ls /dev/serial/by-id/*
```
- You should see the USB serial appear like this (serial is different depending on the motherboard):

  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12702322/197362963-65c93e37-1cd2-49d3-83d3-45a98450a44f.jpg" width="700">

- In case you use same multiple printers connected on the Speeder Pad and you only see one serial when running this command, enter this one instead:
```
ls /dev/serial/by-path/*
```
- If the second command shows multiple results, adjust the path of the serial accordingly, so all instances of ```/by-id/``` should be replaced with ```/by-path/```.

- Go to your Mainsail Web interface then click on `Machine` tab.

- Open `printer.cfg` file and find `[mcu]` section.

- Edit the following existing line with serial you have just obtained like this:
```
serial: /dev/serial/by-id/usb-1a86_USB_Serial-if00-port0
```
- Click on `SAVE & RESTART` at the top right to save the file.

- Your printer should connect to your Speeder Pad.

<br />

## Fix Shutdown button in Mainsail

Shutdown button in Mainsail only restarts the Speeder Pad because some distros don't support `poweroff` function and this is the case for the Ubuntu Operating System.

To correct this, in the SSH command prompt window, enter the following commands (one at time):
```
cd ~/moonraker/scripts
```
```
./set-policykit-rules.sh
```
```
sudo reboot
```
- After reboot, go to your Mainsail Web interface then select the `Machine` tab.

- Open the `moonraker.conf` file and add the following lines:
```
[machine]
shutdown_action: halt
```
- Once done, click on `SAVE & RESTART` at the top right to save the file.

- The Shutdown button now properly shuts off the Pad.

<br />

## Slicer Side Changes

- Change your Start and End Gcode in your Slicer settings like this:

  - For **Cura**:
    - Start Gcode:
      ```
      ;Nozzle diameter = {machine_nozzle_size}
      ;Filament type = {material_type}
      ;Filament name = {material_brand} {material_name}
      ;Filament weight = {filament_weight}
      ;M109 S{material_print_temperature}
      ;M190 S{material_bed_temperature}
      
      START_PRINT BED_TEMP={material_bed_temperature_layer_0} EXTRUDER_TEMP={material_print_temperature_layer_0}
      ```
    - End Gcode:
      ```
      END_PRINT
      ```
    
  - For **PrusaSlicer** / **SuperSlicer**:
    - Start Gcode:
      ```
      START_PRINT BED_TEMP=[first_layer_bed_temperature] EXTRUDER_TEMP=[first_layer_temperature]
      M104 S[first_layer_temperature]
      M190 S[first_layer_bed_temperature]
      ```
    - End Gcode:
      ```
      END_PRINT
      ```

  - For **LycheeSlicer**:
    - Start Gcode:
      ```
      START_PRINT BED_TEMP={bed_temp} EXTRUDER_TEMP={temp}
      ```
    - End Gcode:
      ```
      END_PRINT
      ```
      
   - For **Simplify3D**:
     - Start Gcode:
       ```
       START_PRINT BED_TEMP=[platform0_temperature] EXTRUDER_TEMP=[extruder0_temperature]
       ```
     - End Gcode:
       ```
       END_PRINT
       ```
 
 <br />

- Firmware retraction gives an advantage compared to Slicer retraction, it can be modified during a print (from Mainsail or KlipperScreen) and therefore the same gcode can be printed with different parameters without the need to be re-sliced.

  - For **Cura**, it's needed to install `Klipper Settings Plugin` (available here: [Klipper Settings Plugin](https://github.com/jjgraphix/KlipperSettingsPlugin)) and enable `Enable Firmware Retraction` setting like that:

  ![190531375-dc2def8d-9190-47c8-ae6e-bc7efaf2ce04](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12702322/197653257-9a4c29cc-64c0-4aa4-9077-32b30a9634d2.jpg)

  - For **PrusaSclicer / SuperSlicer**, you just need to enable `Use firmware retraction` setting like that:

![Capture d‚ÄôeÃÅcran 2022-12-12 aÃÄ 03 21 47](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12702322/206947349-f522cf58-ce9f-4bd4-88a6-e73893efeaa3.jpg)
<br />

## Calibrate your Printer

This calibrations can be done by Mainsail Interface with Macros or on Speeder Pad directly.

- Calibrate your extruder by calculing Rotation Distance (see this documentation : <a href="https://www.klipper3d.org/Rotation_Distance.html" target="blank">Rotation Distance | Klipper</a>)

- Calibrate Z-OFFSET with `Z_OFFSET_CALIBRATION` macro.

  - :warning: The leveling sensor must be connected for this operation !

  - This function performs a palpation on the bed, then raises the hotend and starts the manual adjustment function:

    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12702322/219629680-28b7180f-5293-4198-9ac6-2da4fea12d1e.png" width="400">
    
  - Then remove the leveling sensor and using a piece of "copy machine paper" between the bed and the nozzle, adjust the height of the Z until you feel a little friction when pushing the paper back and forth. This helps determine the actual distance between the nozzle and the bed.
    
    Note: Prefer to use the buttons in the `ADVANCED` section, they are more precise and this could prevent the nozzle from forcing on the bed.
  
  - Once these steps are completed, you can click on `ACCEPT` to validate the Z-Offset measurement.
  
  - It's necessary to save the configuration by clicking on the `SAVE` macro.

- Calibrate ENDSTOPS with `ENDSTOPS_CALIBRATION` macro and save the configuration by clicking on the `SAVE` macro.

- Start DELTA CALIBRATION with `DELTA_CALIBRATION` macro and save the configuration by clicking on the `SAVE` macro.

- Start BED LEVELING with `BED_LEVELING` macro and save the configuration by clicking on the `SAVE` macro.

- Start BED PID with `PID_BED_65` macro and save the configuration by clicking on the `SAVE` macro.

- Start HOTEND PID with `PID_HOTEND_220` macro and save the configuration by clicking on the `SAVE` macro.

- After all the calibrations done, I recommend to apply a Safety Offset of 2 mm via the `SECURITY_OFFSET` macro.

  This could prevent the nozzle from scratching or sinking on the bed in the event of an incorrect adjustment of the Z-Offset.
  
- After performing all printer calibrations, then start a print and adjust the first layer using babysteps via the `Adjustments` button in KlipperScreen or via the `Headline` section in Mainsail:

- :warning: Don't save the Z-Offset value, a macro save automatically this value in the variables.cfg file and reload it automatically when Klipper starts:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12702322/188179060-33c3566d-80c7-4f19-8772-da85fd3704c4.png" width="600">

- Some dependencies are required to use ADXL345, install them with this following commands (one at a time):
```
sudo apt update
```
```
sudo apt install python3-numpy python3-matplotlib libatlas-base-dev
```
- Followed by this command to install Numpy in Klipper's environment:
```
~/klippy-env/bin/pip install -v numpy
```
- It's also necessary to compile firmware for Raspberry Pico, enter the following commands (one at a time):
```
cd ~/klipper/
```
```
make menuconfig
```
- Select these settings:
![Capture d‚ÄôeÃÅcran 2022-12-12 aÃÄ 03 17 31](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12702322/206946770-d3ef1763-072e-48c8-8e48-7549f6dfd995.jpg)

- Then on your keyboard press the `Q` key then `Y` to save configuration.

- Enter the following commands to compile firmware (one at a time):
```
make clean
```
```
make
```
- Plug Raspberry Pi Pico into one of the Speeder Pad's USB ports while holding down the `BOOTSEL` button.

- Type this commands to flash firmware (one at a time):
```
cd ~ && sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
```
```
sudo cp /home/pi/klipper/out/klipper.uf2 /mnt/
```
- Now disconnect and reconnect the accelerometer, without holding the `BOOTSEL` button this time to restart it in normal mode.

- Then, type this command to retrieve the serial:
```
cd ~ && ls /dev/serial/by-id/*
```
- You should see 2 serials appear, one is your printer serial an other is the Raspberry Pi Pico, the one with the mention `Klipper Rp2040`:

  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12702322/188280489-5db90d97-6f15-45a8-9f06-bd9da21b2cac.jpg" width="700">

- Go to your Mainsail Web interface then click on `Machine` tab.

- Open `adxl345_pico.cfg` file and edit following line with serial you have just obtained:
```
serial: /dev/serial/by-id/usb-Klipper_rp2040_E6605481DB318D34-if00
```
- Click on `SAVE & RESTART` at the top right to save the file.

- Then uncomment (remove the #) to the following line in the `printer.cfg` file to enable ADXL support:
```
[include adxl345_pico.cfg]
```
- Click on `SAVE & RESTART` at the top right to save the file.

- You should see the `ADXL MCU` connecting to Klipper.

- You can test accelerometer by entering this command:
```
ACCELEROMETER_QUERY
```
- Something like this must be returned:
```
accelerometer values (x, y, z): 5551.544565, 7048.078582, -1924.535449
```
- Enter this command to measure the noise of the accelerometer for each axis:
```
MEASURE_AXES_NOISE
```
- You should get some baseline numbers for the noise of accelerometer on the axes (should be somewhere in the range of ~1-100). Too high axes noise (e.g. 1000 and more) can be indicative of the sensor issues, problems with its power, or too noisy imbalanced fans.

- To measure the resonances, see here: https://www.klipper3d.org/Measuring_Resonances.html

**Note:** After tests, it's better to disable the ADXL by commenting out the `[include adxl345_pico.cfg]` line again.
