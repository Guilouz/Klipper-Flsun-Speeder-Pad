## Enable Root Access

By default, root access is not allowed on Speeder Pad. To enable it, follow these instructions:

- Download this pack and unzip it : [Root Access Enabler.zip](https://github.com/Guilouz/Klipper-Flsun-V400/files/9482488/Root.Access.Enabler.zip)

- Copy `update.sh` file to the root of USB stick provided with V400.

- Printer off, insert the USB stick into one of the ports of the Speeder Pad.

- Turn on the printer and wait for it to start. Once it has restarted, you can remove the USB stick.

- You now have Root access for user `pi`.

- To prevent the script from running on every boot, delete the `update.sh` file and the newly created `update.over` file from the USB stick.

<br />

![Capture d‚ÄôeÃÅcran 2022-09-03 aÃÄ 14 20 15](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12702322/188270163-c9e24cf3-d11a-4870-bc0b-343b1bd32d61.jpg)

<br />

## Change Password

It's possible to change the password of the `pi` user:

- In the SSH command prompt window, enter the following command:
```
passwd
```
- You‚Äôll get asked to enter your current password for verification -> `flsun`.

- After verification, you can type in your new password and press `Enter`.
  - **Note: You‚Äôll not be able to see any characters on the display while entering the password. So, don‚Äôt panic; just type in your password and press `Enter`.**

- Once you‚Äôve successfully verified your password, it‚Äôll get applied right away.

<br />

## Change Timezone

By default, V400 are on Asia timezone. To change that, follow these instructions:

- In the SSH command prompt window, enter the following command to check the current time zone:
```
timedatectl
```
- You can view the available timezones by entering this command:
```
timedatectl list-timezones
```
- You can also find your timezone using this command (replace Paris with your nearest major city):
```
timedatectl list-timezones | grep -i Paris
```
- Then unlink the current timezone with this command (you will need to enter the Root password):
```
sudo unlink /etc/localtime
```
- You can now set the new timezone with this command (replace Europe/Paris by the new timezone):
```
sudo ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Paris /etc/localtime
```
- You can then verify that the change has been taken into account by retyping this command:
```
timedatectl
```

<br />

## Change Wi-Fi Location

By default, there is no location defined.

- In the SSH command prompt window, enter the following command to check the current Wi-Fi location:
```
iw reg get
```
- You obtain this:
```
global
country 00: DFS-UNSET
        (755 - 928 @ 2), (N/A, 20), (N/A), NO-IR
        (2402 - 2472 @ 40), (N/A, 20), (N/A)
        (2457 - 2482 @ 20), (N/A, 20), (N/A), AUTO-BW, NO-IR
        (2474 - 2494 @ 20), (N/A, 20), (N/A), NO-OFDM, NO-IR
        (5170 - 5250 @ 80), (N/A, 20), (N/A), AUTO-BW, NO-IR
        (5250 - 5330 @ 80), (N/A, 20), (0 ms), DFS, AUTO-BW, NO-IR

        (5735 - 5835 @ 80), (N/A, 20), (N/A), NO-IR
        (57240 - 63720 @ 2160), (N/A, 0), (N/A)
```
- All available locations can be displayed with this command:
```
sudo nano /usr/share/zoneinfo/zone.tab
```
- To change the location enter the following command replacing `FR` by your country (you will need to enter the Root password):
```
sudo iw reg set FR
```
You can verify that the change has been made by entering this command again:
```
iw reg get
```
- You obtain this (related to your country):
```
global
country FR: DFS-ETSI
        (2400 - 2483 @ 40), (N/A, 20), (N/A)
        (5150 - 5250 @ 80), (N/A, 23), (N/A), NO-OUTDOOR, AUTO-BW
        (5250 - 5350 @ 80), (N/A, 20), (0 ms), NO-OUTDOOR, DFS, AUTO-BW
        (5470 - 5725 @ 160), (N/A, 26), (0 ms), DFS
        (5725 - 5875 @ 80), (N/A, 13), (N/A)
        (5945 - 6425 @ 160), (N/A, 23), (N/A), NO-OUTDOOR
        (57000 - 71000 @ 2160), (N/A, 40), (N/A)
```
- To make the location permanent, enter the following command replacing `FR` by your country (you will need to enter the Root password):
```
sudo sed -i 's/^REG.*=$/&FR/' /etc/default/crda
```
- Then, this command:
```
sudo sed -i '/^exit 0/ d' /etc/rc.local
```
- And this command replacing `FR` by your country:
```
echo -e "iw reg set FR\nexit 0" | sudo tee -a /etc/rc.local
```
- Then reboot with this command:
```
sudo reboot
```
<br />
<br />

- If you are experiencing Wifi disconnects, you can disable Power Save functionality with this command:
```
sudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/default-wifi-powersave-on.conf
```
- On the page that appears, change the value to 2 instead of 3 as follows:
```
[connection]
wifi.powersave = 2
```
- Then press `Ctrl+X` to exit then `Y` to save and `Enter` to confirm.

- Enter this command to restart Wi-Fi service:
```
sudo service network-manager restart
```

<br />

## Switch to Official Klipper Builds

By default, FLSUN does not use builds from official GitHub repositories. Updates point to Gitee repositories which are very slow, sometimes inaccessible and not updated.
In addition, during Delta Calibration, tower angles and delta radius are never recalculated in their Klipper build, which can cause several issues.

To upgrade to official builds, follow these instructions:

- In the SSH command prompt window, enter the following command to install Kiauh:
```
git clone https://github.com/th33xitus/kiauh.git
```
- Launch Kiauh by entering this command:
```
./kiauh/kiauh.sh
```
- This window should appear:

- When it's done, go back to main menu by typing `B` then `Enter`.

- Exit Kiauh by typing `Q` then `Enter`.

- Your Speeder Pad now running offical builds of Klipper and Moonraker.

Note: You can also install Fluidd if you don't like the Mainsail interface.

<br />

## Update Mainsail

- Go to your Mainsail Web interface then click on `Machine` tab.

- Right-click on the `moonraker.conf` file then `Download` to make a backup of the original file. Keep this file carefully for possible backtracking.

- Now, still on Mainsail, open the `moonraker.conf` file and add the following lines:
```
[update_manager client mainsail]
type: web
channel: stable
repo: mainsail-crew/mainsail
path: ~/mainsail
```
- Once done, click on `Save & close` at the top right to save the file.

- You can now click the refresh button (still in the Machine tab) on the `Update Manager` tile.

- You will see a new `mainsail` line appear.

![Capture d‚ÄôeÃÅcran 2022-09-03 aÃÄ 15 49 16](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12702322/188273402-84c3c399-5c88-4d6f-82e2-3bd9b134dbd7.jpg)

<br />

```
[update_manager timelapse]
type: git_repo
primary_branch: main
path: ~/moonraker-timelapse
origin: https://github.com/mainsail-crew/moonraker-timelapse.git
managed_services: klipper moonraker
```
- Once done, click on `Save & close` at the top right to save the file.

- You can now click the refresh button (still in the Machine tab) on the `Update Manager` tile.

![Capture d‚ÄôeÃÅcran 2022-09-04 aÃÄ 18 46 12](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12702322/188324381-3ab16337-e7da-4029-a318-ba41a4884ded.jpg)

<br />

## Update Motherboard Firmware

It's important that your motherboard firmware version matches with the installed Klipper version.

Version is visible on `System Loads` tile -> `mcu` section (in `Machine` tab).

To update firmware, follow these instructions:

- In the SSH command prompt window, enter the following commands (one at a time):
```
cd ~/klipper/
make menuconfig
```
- Select these settings:
```
[*] Enable extra low-level configuration options
Micro-controller Architecture (STMicroelectronics STM32)
Processor model (STM32F103)
Bootloader offset (28KiB bootloader)
Clock Reference (8 MHz crystal)
Communication interface (Serial (on USART3 PB11/PB10))
```

![Capture d‚ÄôeÃÅcran 2022-09-03 aÃÄ 15 58 37](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12702322/188273866-1981aa1b-f01e-40c4-a8c4-4f1935adb821.jpg)

- Then on your keyboard press the `Q` key then `Y` to save configuration.

- Enter the following commands to compile firmware (one at a time):
```
make clean
make
```
- Then this one to convert firmware:
```
./scripts/update_mks_robin.py out/klipper.bin out/Robin_nano35.bin
```
- V400 motherboard doesn't support DFU mode, so it's not possible to install the firmware directly. It's therefore necessary to install it manually.

- Get the firmware named `Robin_nano35.bin` in `/home/pi/klipper/out/` directory (on the left part of MobaXterm).

- Copy it to the root of an microSD card formatted in FAT32 and an allocation size of 4096.

- Insert the microSD card into the motherboard then turn on the printer.

- Installation only takes a few seconds, to verify that the firmware has been successfully installed, the file on the microSD card must have been renamed to `ROBIN_NANO35.BIN.CUR` and the version on the `System Loads` tile must have been changed.

Note: Access to the microSD port of the motherboard being impossible as it is, because of the pneufit just in front, I modeled a new support available in `STL Files` section.

![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12702322/188274940-e660a798-93a0-495f-9cf0-842c3893f6d4.jpg)

I also recommend using a microSD extension for future updates to avoid removing the cover each time.

<br />

## Use Configurations

- Go to your Mainsail Web interface then click on `Machine` tab.

- Right-click on the `printer.cfg` file then `Download` to make a backup of the original file. Keep this file carefully for possible backtracking.

- Download and unzip my repository zip file here : https://github.com/Guilouz/Klipper-Flsun-V400/archive/refs/heads/main.zip

- Then upload `printer.cfg`, `macros.cfg` and `adxl345.cfg` files located in `Configurations` directory.

- Restart printer to take effect.

<br />

## Calibrate your Printer

This calibrations can be done by Mainsail Interface with Macros or on Speeder Pad directly.

- Start BED PID and save configuration.

- Start HOTEND PID and save configuration.

- Start ENDSTOP CALIBRATION and save configuration.

- Start DELTA CALIBRATION and save configuration.

- Start BED LEVELING and save configuration.

- Adjust Z-OFFSET, first you need to move to Z=0 and then adjust nozzle position with a sheet of paper.
  - Note: The Z-Offset is saved in real time including when adjusting babysteps.

- To calibrate your extruder, see here: https://www.klipper3d.org/Rotation_Distance.html
