## ADXL345 Wiring

To use ADXL345 with FLSUN V400 it's necessary to use it via USB with a Raspberry Pi Pico.

## Enable Root Access

By default Root access is not allowed on Speeder Pad. To activate them, follow these instructions:

- Download this pack and unzip it : [Root Access Enabler.zip](https://github.com/Guilouz/Klipper-Flsun-V400/files/9482488/Root.Access.Enabler.zip)

- Copy `update.sh` file to the root of USB stick provided with V400.

- Printer off, insert the USB stick into one of the ports of the Speeder Pad.

- Turn on the printer and wait for it to start. Once it has restarted, you can remove the USB stick.

- You now have Root access for user `pi`.

- To prevent the script from running on every boot, delete the `update.sh` file and the newly created `update.over` file from the USB stick.

## SSH Connection

- Download and install the MobaXterm software here: https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html

- Launch it then click on the `Session` icon then `SSH`:

- On the new displayed window, enter the password `flsun` (it's not displayed when typing, this is normal):

- An authorization window will appear, authorize it. It is also possible that another window asking you to change the password will appear, ignore it.

- Once connected, on the left part of the window you have access to the folders and files of your Speeder Pad and on the right part to the SSH command prompt window:

<br />

## Password Change

It's possible to change the password of the `pi` user:

- In the SSH command prompt window, enter the following command:
```
passwd
```
- You‚Äôll get asked to enter your current password for verification -> `flsun`.

- After verification, you can type in your new password and press `Enter`.

**Note: You‚Äôll not be able to see any characters on the display while entering the password. So, don‚Äôt panic; just type in your password and press `Enter`.**

- Once you‚Äôve successfully verified your password, it‚Äôll get applied right away.

<br />

## Change Timezone

By default, V400 are on Asia timezone. To change that, follow these instructions:

- In the SSH command prompt window, enter the following command to check the current time zone:
```
timedatectl
```
- You can view the available timezones by entering this command:
```
timedatectl list-timezones
```
- You can also find your timezone using this command (replace Paris with your nearest major city):
```
timedatectl list-timezones | grep -i Paris
```
- Then unlink the current timezone with this command (you will need to enter the Root password):
```
sudo unlink /etc/localtime
```
- You can now set the new timezone with this command (replace Europe/Paris by the new timezone):
```
sudo ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Paris /etc/localtime
```
- You can then verify that the change has been taken into account by retyping this command:
```
timedatectl
```
