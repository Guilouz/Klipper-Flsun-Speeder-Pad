Wait until the bar is fully charged and green, this may take several minutes (roughly 10 to 15 minutes)

When it's done, turn off Speeder Pad and remove the microSD card. Turn Speeder Pad back on, it should start normally and arrive on KlipperScreen splashscreen.

Once this is done, you can now [Configure WiFi](configure-wifi.md).
