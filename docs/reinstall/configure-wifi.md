# Configure WiFi

- Go to `Menu` --> `Network` and connect it to your WiFi network.

The WiFi network you select must be running on 2.4ghz, if you try to connect to a 5ghz network it will not work correctly.


You can now connect to your Speeder Pad over SSH, continue on at [Connecting to SSH](connecting-to-ssh.md).
