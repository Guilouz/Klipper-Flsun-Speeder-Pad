# Configuration

Download and unzip my repository zip file here: https://github.com/Guilouz/Klipper-Flsun-Speeder-Pad/archive/refs/heads/main.zip

Go to your Mainsail Web interface then click on `Machine` tab.

Then upload `KlipperScreen.conf`, `printer.cfg`, `macros.cfg`, `neopixels.cfg` and `adxl345.cfg` files located in `Configurations` directory according to your printer.

Restart Speeder Pad and printer to take effect.

You now need to configure the Speeder Pad to talk to your Motherboard, continue at [USB Serial](../usb-serial.md).
